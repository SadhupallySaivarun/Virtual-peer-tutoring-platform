# Virtual-peer-tutoring-platform
How Our Platform Works

1. Finding Students Who Need Help
- We use our Virtual Peer Tutoring Platform to filter students who already have access to education.  
- For students in remote or underprivileged areas, we identify those who lack basic resources (books, internet, school fees, etc.).  
- We allow users (students, teachers, or volunteers) to *report areas where students need help.

2. Quiz-Based Fundraising Model
- Students participate in quizzes related to their recent tutoring sessions.  
- To enter the quiz, they pay a small participation fee.
- The money collected is used to help students who cannot afford education.

3. Rewards for Quiz Participants 
- Top scorers earn 10% of the collected amount as a reward.  
- Non-winners can still earn by helping others:
  - If they provide accurate information about a location where students need help, they can earn a higher amount* than the quiz winners.  

4. Verifying Requests for Help 
- When someone reports a location in need of support, we verify the request by:  
  - Contacting local school principals, orphanage heads, or community leaders.  
  - Asking them to submit proof (documents, photos, or reports).  
  - Cross-checking with local student groups.  
5. Connecting with NGOs & Supporters 
- Once verified, we send the data to NGOs and organizations that have signed up on our platform.  
- These organizations can directly offer help in the form of books, school fees, infrastructure, or mentorship programs.
